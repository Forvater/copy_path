<div class="wikidoc"><b>Project Description</b><br />This extension is intended to make the task of finding and sharing the UNC path for a mapped drive easier as I often need to find this information from colleagues or pass this information to colleagues. I created this utility to make it simpler. <br /><br />This is a Windows Explorer shell extension that will allow you to right click on a drive or file system object and copy the path of the file to the clipbpoard. If the drive is a mapped drive or the file system object exits on a mapped drive it will resolve the full UNC path.<br /><br /><br /><b>Supported Systems</b><br />Although designed for Windows XP, I will maintain builds of this extension for the following versions of Windows.
<ul><li>Windows 7</li>
<li>Windows Server 2008</li>
<li>Windows Vista</li>
<li>Windows XP</li>
<li>Windows 2003</li></ul>
<br /><br /><b>Installation</b><br />To install this extension follow these steps
<ol><li>Download latest build for your operating system from this page</li>
<li>Extract the DLL to a folder on your hard drive such as %WINDIR%\System32</li>
<li>From the command prompt issue the following commands
<ol><li>cd %WINDIR%\System32</li>
<li>regsvr32 CopyPath.dll</li></ol></li></ol>
<br />The extension will now be installed so you can right click on a drive or file system object and you will see the option &#39;Copy Path&#39;<br /><br /><br /><b>Uninstall</b><br />To uninstall this extension follow these steps
<ol><li>Open command prompt and issue the following commands. <i>Note that I assume you placed the CopyPath.dll into the %WINDIR%\System32 directory</i>
<ol><li>cd %WINDIR%\System32</li>
